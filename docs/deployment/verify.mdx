## Verify the install

SSH into the instance and check each component:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/nightshift-dev.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP>
```

```bash
firecracker --version
ls /opt/nightshift/vmlinux /opt/nightshift/rootfs.ext4
uv --version
```

All three commands should succeed without errors.

## Verify production deployment

If you deployed with `production.sh` or `setup.sh --production`, verify TLS and the health endpoint:

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```
