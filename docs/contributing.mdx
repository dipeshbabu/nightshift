Contributions are welcome!

## Workflow

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Make changes and run the CLI locally
4. Ensure builds still work:
   ```bash
   bun run build:single
   ```
5. Open a PR with context and screenshots for UI changes

## Getting started

If you are unsure where to start, open an issue with your idea or bug report first.

## Code style

- Use Bun-native APIs (see `CLAUDE.md`)
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Include tests for new functionality

## Pull requests

When opening a PR:

- Provide clear context about what the change does
- Include screenshots for any UI changes
- Link to any related issues
