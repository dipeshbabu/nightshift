description: Configure Nightshift and OpenCode settings
---

Nightshift delegates configuration to OpenCode. If you already use OpenCode config files, they are picked up automatically.

## Config file locations

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `opencode.json` | Project-level (in your project root) |
| `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` | Global settings |

## Supported settings

OpenCode configuration supports:

- Model defaults
- Keybind overrides
- Custom commands
- MCP servers
- And more

Refer to the [OpenCode documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs) for the full configuration reference.

## Updating tool versions

Pinned tool versions are defined in `src/index.ts`. To update:

1. Edit the version constants in `src/index.ts`
2. Re-run `nightshift install --prefix <prefix>` to download the new versions
