## Install

```bash
uv add nightshift-sdk
```

This provides the SDK (`NightshiftApp`, `AgentConfig`) and the CLI (`nightshift` command).


## CLI workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Initialize a project">
```bash
mkdir agent
cd agent
uv init
```
    <Note>
    You'll need a pyproject.toml in the root of your directory. This is how Nightshift knows your agent's depedancies
    </Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Create the agent">

Create a Python file with a `NightshiftApp` and one or more `@app.agent()` functions:

```python my_agent.py
from nightshift import NightshiftApp, AgentConfig

app = NightshiftApp()

@app.agent(AgentConfig(
    vcpu_count=2,
    mem_size_mib=2048,
))
async def my_agent(prompt: str):
    yield {"type": "agent.message", "content": f"Received: {prompt}"}
```

- The function must be `async def` and use `yield` (async generator)
- `prompt: str` is the only parameter it's what the user passes to your function at runtime
- Each `yield` sends an SSE event back to the caller 
- Yielded values can be dicts, dataclasses, or Pydantic models; they're auto-serialized with a `type` field and `timestamp` added if missing
- Inside the VM, the workspace is always at `/workspace`
    <Note>
    You'll need a pyproject.toml in the root of your directory. This is how Nightshift knows your agent's depedancies
    </Note>

</Step>
  <Step title="Login">
    ```bash
    nightshift login --url https://api.nightshift.sh --api-key ns_<key>
    ```
    Saves credentials to `~/.nightshift/config.toml`. 

    <Note>
    If you're running a self-hosted platform, replace `api.nightshift.sh` with your server's hostname or `http://<IP>:3000`.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    ```bash
    nightshift deploy my_agent.py
    ```
    The CLI imports the file, discovers all `@app.agent()` functions, finds the project root (walks up to `pyproject.toml`)
    , creates a tar.gz archive, and uploads to the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="List agents">

    ```bash
    nightshift agents
    ```

    This will show the agents you have deployed in Nightshift.
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run an agent">
    ```bash
    nightshift run my_agent -p "What does this code do?" -f
    ```
    <Note>
    - `-f` / `--follow` streams events to stdout in real time
    - Without `-f`, prints the run ID and exits
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="View logs">
    ```bash
    nightshift logs <run_id>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete an agent">
    ```bash
    nightshift agents rm my_agent
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Multiple agents per file

```python
app = NightshiftApp()

@app.agent(AgentConfig(vcpu_count=2))
async def explorer(prompt: str):
    ...

@app.agent(AgentConfig(vcpu_count=4, mem_size_mib=4096))
async def builder(prompt: str):
    ...
```

`nightshift deploy` uploads both. Each gets its own registry entry and can be run independently.

## Custom agent names

```python
@app.agent(AgentConfig(), name="my-custom-name")
async def internal_fn(prompt: str):
    ...
```

The agent registers as `my-custom-name`, not `internal_fn`.
