## Prerequisites

Before installing Nightshift, ensure you have:

- macOS or Linux (x64 or arm64)
- A modern terminal emulator like [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org)
- Network access 

## Download the binary 

The most straight forward way to install Nightshift is by using the curl command below:

```bash
curl https://nightshift.sh/install | sh
```

this will run a shell script that downloads and installs the latest release of Nightshift from our distrubution channel.

## Build from source

Nightshift is a [Bun](https://bun.com/) project and is able to compile down to a single binary for your architecture.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nightshiftco/nightshift.git
cd nightshift
```

```bash
bun run build:single
```

The binary will be output to `dist/nightshift-<os>-<arch>/bin/nightshift`.

## Toolchain layout

Nightshift installs into a prefix directory you control, you can think of this as the agent's profile:

```
<prefix>/
  bin/          # symlinks: opencode, uv, rg
  tools/        # extracted tool archives
  python/       # uv-managed Python installations
  venvs/
    data-science/  # numpy + pandas
  workspace/    # writeable uv workspace
```

Pinned tool versions live in `src/index.ts` so you can update them centrally. We're working on making this more streamlined.
