description: Install Nightshift and its dependencies

## Prerequisites

Before installing Nightshift, ensure you have:

- macOS or Linux (x64 or arm64)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed and on PATH
- System tools: `curl`, `tar`, and `unzip`
- Network access to GitHub releases

## Install from source

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nightshiftco/nightshift.git
cd nightshift
bun install
```

Build a single binary for your current platform:

```bash
bun run build:single
```

The binary will be output to `dist/nightshift-<os>-<arch>/bin/nightshift`.

## Toolchain layout

Nightshift installs into a prefix directory you control:

```
<prefix>/
  bin/          # symlinks: opencode, python, uv, rg
  tools/        # extracted tool archives
  venvs/
    data-science/  # numpy + pandas
```

Pinned tool versions live in `src/index.ts` so you can update them centrally.
