<Warning>
  Nightshift is currently in its infancy and is subject to change and incompleteness.
  If you find a bug, or have an idea to improve Nightshift, please raise an issue on [Github](https://github.com/nightshiftco/nightshift/tree/main).
</Warning>

## Install the toolchain

After building or installing Nightshift, prepare the agent and it's environment with:

```bash
nightshift install --prefix ~/.demo
```

This downloads and installs:
- OpenCode (and soon Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex see [Contributing](https://docs.nightshift.sh/contributing) to help us out)
- Python 3.13 (Stand alone python)
- uv (Python package manager)
- ripgrep
- bwrap (if you're on linux)

## Launch the Agent


### Run Nightshift
```bash
nightshift run 
```

This will default to the last ran or installed prefix. To change the prefix you want Nightshift to run you can pass the `--prefix` flag:

### Running Nightshift with Prefix 
```bash
nightshift run --prefix ~/.demo
```

Currently, Nightshift will default to running Opencode as the Agent Harness. We'd like to add support for other Agent harnesses in the future.

You have the option to run the Nightshift TUI which will eventually be a simplified version of the Opencode TUI used for our customers (who are not technical).

The Nightshift TUI is still a work in progress.


### Running the Nightshift TUI

```bash
nightshift run --run-nightshift-tui
```
