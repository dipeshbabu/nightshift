## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with EC2 permissions
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed locally
- A clone of the Nightshift repository

## Provision a dev instance

```bash
./infra/setup.sh
```

This launches a `c5.metal` EC2 instance with Firecracker, a Linux kernel, an Ubuntu rootfs, and all dependencies pre-installed. See [Provision Instance](/deployment/provision) for details.

Connection details are saved to `infra/.instance` and used automatically by the deploy script.

## Run locally

Install dependencies and start the server locally (requires a machine with `/dev/kvm`):

```bash
uv sync
uv run nightshift serve
```

## Tear down

```bash
./infra/teardown.sh
```
