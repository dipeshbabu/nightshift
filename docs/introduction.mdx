Nightshift runs Agents in microVMs using [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) for [hardware level isolation](https://linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page). 
Each agent gets its own isolated VM with dedicated vCPUs, memory, filesystem, and network and streams results back via Server-Sent Events.

## What is Nightshift?

Nightshift is an open source platform for deploying and running Agents in secure, efficient, isolated environments. 
You write an agent as a Python async generator, deploy it with a single CLI command, and run it on demand. 
Each run spins up a dedicated Firecracker microVM with its own resources and network, executes your agent, and streams events back in real time.

A hosted platform is available at `api.nightshift.sh` or you can self-host on any linux machine with KVM support.

## How it works

1. **Install** the SDK: `uv add nightshift-sdk` (or install as a uv tool)
2. **Write** an agent as a Python async generator decorated with `@app.agent()`
3. **Deploy** it to the platform with `nightshift deploy`
4. **Run** it on demand with `nightshift run` each run gets its own isolated microVM
5. **Stream** results back in real time via SSE
