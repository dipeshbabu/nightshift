description: Bun-native CLI for isolated, reproducible OpenCode environments
---

Nightshift is a Bun-native CLI that installs and runs OpenCode in an isolated, reproducible toolchain, with an optional custom TUI built on OpenTUI + Solid.

It is designed for teams that want a consistent OpenCode environment (pinned tool versions, bundled Python tooling, and a focused terminal UI) without relying on system installs.

## What you get

- **Isolated toolchain** in a prefix directory (OpenCode, Python, uv, ripgrep)
- **Data-science venv** with NumPy and pandas preinstalled
- **Nightshift TUI** that attaches to an OpenCode server and adds session, model, and command workflows
- **Single Bun-driven build pipeline** that emits standalone binaries

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux (x64 or arm64)
- Bun installed and on PATH
- System tools: `curl`, `tar`, and `unzip`
- Network access to GitHub releases for OpenCode and tool downloads
