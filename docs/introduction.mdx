<Warning>
  Nightshift is currently in its infancy and is subject to change and incompleteness.
  If you find a bug, or have an idea to improve Nightshift, please raise an issue on [Github](https://github.com/nightshiftco/nightshift/tree/main) and join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nightshiftoss/shared_invite/zt-3p5dshiiq-hjB8558QvURDgqqCI7e8RQ) for updates.
</Warning>

Nightshift is a CLI that takes Coding Agents like [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/), [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview), and [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/) and turns them into autonomous problem solvers that can complete complex, long-running knowledge work tasks.

## Why Nightshift

Coding Agents are powerful, but they're designed for interactive, single-turn workflows. 
Nightshift treats the Coding Agent as infrastructure and gives the process the environment, feedback loops, and isolation it needs to [solve complex problems autonomously](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler).

Nightshift provides:

- **Isolated environments** — Each agent runs in its own [prefix directory](/system/prefix-directory) with pinned tools, a managed Python installation, XDG isolation, and a lightweight sandbox. Nothing touches your host system.
- **Autonomous execution** — The [Ralph loop](/ralph-loop) pairs a worker agent with a boss agent. The worker codes, the boss evaluates, and the loop continues until the task is done.
- **Concurrent task isolation** — [Worktrees](/worktrees) give each task its own git branch and working directory so multiple tasks can run in parallel without conflicts. The agent learns from the collective work of all other agents.
- **Reproducibility** — Every tool version is pinned. Every environment is built from scratch. The same install command produces the same result on any machine.

## How It Works

```bash
# Install the toolchain into an isolated prefix
nightshift install --prefix ~/.my-agent

# Opens OpenCode setting the prefix as your working directory 
nightshift run

# Run Ralph with Job TUI
nightshift run --ralph --serve --run-nightshift-tui

# Run Ralph server
nightshift run --ralph --serve --serve-port 3000
```

Nightshift [installs](/install) OpenCode, uv, ripgrep, and ty into a self-contained directory, scaffolds a Python workspace, and gives you a ready-to-go agent environment. From there you can run interactively or kick off autonomous tasks through the [Ralph server API](/system/ralph-server).
